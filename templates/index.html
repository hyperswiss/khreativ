                    <h4>Assignments</h4>
                    <p>Design a website for a Consulting company which core business is hotels and restaurants, without having it looking like a hotel website.</p>
                    <p>It had to include all functionnalities of a standard website and have a good but professional looking presentation, without being too flashy</p>
                    <p>I wanted also to do it all by myself, no website builder involved, to get a better control in case of problem</p>
                    <h4>Difficulties</h4>
                    <p>First of all, it was my first website, development was accompanied by a learning phase</p>
                    <p>First consideration was to make it a one page or several pages, and if several pages, with which program was I going to do it ?</p>
                    <p>I had few tutorials on Django done, but I wasn't enough familiar with the url patterns, at the beginning I didn't know much of PHP and didn't like JS too much, I did choose then to do a one page</p>
                    <p>Another problem was to find some elements that wouldn't show anywhere else</p>
                    <h4>Solutions</h4>
                    <p>I've find a way to do my own numbering (designed with Inkscape), and, by luck, a hint on how to make partial borders, simple and elegant was all I wanted</p>
                    <p>This fact that it was my own company website, was not really an advantage (I kept complicating things one after another), but at least I had time to do it how I wanted it (COVID period)</p>
                    <p>Trying to find solutions on how to do a secured form, I discovered PHP and the wide array of possibilities that it opened to me.</p>
                    <p>I could then easily add more pages without having to redo the navigation bar or footer or image gallery for each page, I just had to include them in the code to have them showing up. 
                        It would have been possible in Django but again, I was finding it a bit complicated at that time</p>
                    <p>I also tried myself on Bootstrap for a while, but quickly droped it for Sass (not scss, sass), having some learned a bit of Python, indentation was something I found completely logical, and I had a better control that way</p>
                    <p>One thing was to find a nice color for the secondary pages background. Plain colors don't look too good on my opinion. Solution was to isolate a part of a photo found on unsplash and to use it as background. Some like it, some don't, I do.</p>
                    <h4>The form</h4>
                    <p>Quite a big part. I did start that form by gathering informations from diverse tutorials on JS and PHP, and finally selected PHP</p>
                    <p>I wanted it to be secure, method POST, escape of special characters, I also wanted that when someone was filling it up, a confirmation screen would appear with all the details, an email being send to me, and it had to be registered in a database, quite a challenge for a newcomer</p>
                    <p>Today it's done, tested and working</p>
